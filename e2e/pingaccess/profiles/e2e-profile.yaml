# E2E transform profile — routes specs to dedicated path prefixes
#
# Each spec is bound to its own URL path pattern so tests can exercise
# different transformation capabilities independently. Two apps use
# this profile:
#   - Main app (contextRoot=/api, errorMode=PASS_THROUGH)
#   - Deny app (contextRoot=/deny-api, errorMode=DENY)
#
# See: docs/architecture/features/002/e2e-expansion-plan.md

transforms:
  # ── Bidirectional rename (Tests 1–2) ──

  # ── Header injection (Test 7) ──
  - spec: e2e-header-inject@1.0.0
    direction: request
    match:
      path: "/api/headers/**"
      method: POST

  # ── Context variables — cookies, query params, session (Tests 9–11) ──
  - spec: e2e-context@1.0.0
    direction: request
    match:
      path: "/api/context/**"
      method: POST

  # ── Error mode — PASS_THROUGH app (Test 17) ──
  - spec: e2e-error@1.0.0
    direction: request
    match:
      path: "/api/error/**"
      method: POST

  # ── Error mode — DENY app (Tests 18–19) ──
  # Same spec, different path prefix (the DENY app uses contextRoot=/deny-api)
  - spec: e2e-error@1.0.0
    direction: request
    match:
      path: "/deny-api/error/**"
      method: POST

  # ── Status code override (Test 15) ──
  - spec: e2e-status-override@1.0.0
    direction: response
    match:
      path: "/api/status-test/**"

  # ── URL rewrite (Test 16) ──
  - spec: e2e-url-rewrite@1.0.0
    direction: request
    match:
      path: "/api/rewrite/**"
      method: POST

  # ── Non-JSON response pass-through (Test 12) ──
  # Routes through e2e-rename on response direction so the adapter's
  # wrapResponse/handleResponse code path runs (detects non-JSON → skip body JSLT).
  # Without this entry, the profile returns PASSTHROUGH and the adapter code
  # path is never exercised (identified during adversarial review, BUG 4).
  - spec: e2e-rename@1.0.0
    direction: response
    match:
      path: "/api/html/**"

  # ── Non-standard status code pass-through (Test 13) ──
  # Same rationale as above — routes through a response spec so the adapter
  # actually processes the 277 status instead of just PASSTHROUGHing.
  - spec: e2e-rename@1.0.0
    direction: response
    match:
      path: "/api/status/**"

  - spec: e2e-session@1.0.0
    direction: request
    match:
      path: "/api/session/**"
      method: POST

  # ── Session context — OIDC Web Session (Tests 23–24, Phase 8b) ──
  # The Web app uses contextRoot=/web/session, so paths arrive as /web/session/...
  - spec: e2e-session@1.0.0
    direction: request
    match:
      path: "/web/session/**"
