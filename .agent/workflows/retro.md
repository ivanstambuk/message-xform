# /retro — Session Retrospective

Perform this at the end of a session or after completing a significant piece of work.

## Steps

### 1. Summarize Work Done
Review the session's activity:
- List all files created, modified, or deleted.
- Summarize the key changes and decisions made.
- Note any deviations from the original plan or approach.

### 2. Capture Learnings
Identify anything that should be persisted:
- **New conventions**: Patterns or rules that emerged during the session → update `AGENTS.md`.
- **Pitfalls**: Gotchas, traps, or debugging insights → document in a relevant location.
- **Plan updates**: If vision, features, or priorities shifted → update `PLAN.md`.

### 3. Update Documentation

Apply the learnings:
- Update `AGENTS.md` with any new rules or conventions.
- Update `PLAN.md` if scope, priorities, or technical decisions changed.
- Ensure all changes are committed.

### 4. Report
Present a concise retrospective to the user:
- **Done**: What was accomplished.
- **Learned**: Key takeaways or decisions.
- **Changed**: What docs were updated and why.
- **Open**: Anything left unresolved or worth revisiting.
