# Pending Task

## Current State
SDD workflow initialized. Feature 001 spec written (generic transformation engine).
Research complete for transformation patterns (Kong, JOLT, JSONata, AWS VTL, Apigee).

## Completed This Session
1. ✅ Researched SDD structure from openauth-sim and journeyforge (consumer projects)
2. ✅ Created SDD infrastructure: templates, open-questions, roadmap, decisions
3. ✅ Wrote Feature 001 spec (initially PingAM-specific, then generalized per user feedback)
4. ✅ Researched transformation patterns: Kong, AWS VTL, Apigee, JOLT, JSONata, JMESPath
5. ✅ Wrote `docs/research/transformation-patterns.md` with gap analysis
6. ✅ Updated AGENTS.md with full SDD documentation hierarchy

## Next Steps
1. **Review Feature 001 spec with user** — get feedback on the pipeline operations,
   bidirectional model, and profile/spec separation.
2. **Write Feature 001 plan.md** — implementation plan for the core engine.
3. **Write Feature 001 tasks.md** — task breakdown for implementation.
4. **Bootstrap Maven project** — multi-module structure (core + adapters).
5. **Write first transform profile** — PingAM callback prettification as a profile
   using the generic engine.
6. **Research PingGateway** — filter/handler API for the second adapter.
