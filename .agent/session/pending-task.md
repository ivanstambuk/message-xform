# Pending Task

**Focus**: Feature 002 — PingAccess Adapter
**Status**: Spec complete and aligned with SDK guide. Ready for implementation planning.
**Next Step**: Create `plan.md` and `tasks.md` for Feature 002, then begin adapter implementation.

## Context Notes
- Spec is at 1,250+ lines, fully enriched and cross-validated against SDK guide
- SDK guide is at 2,804 lines, covering 18 sections and 112+ SDK classes
- 6 unpushed commits on `main` — push before starting implementation
- Feature 002 spec is marked "Spec Ready"

## Suggested Next Actions
1. Push unpushed commits: `git push origin main`
2. Create Feature 002 implementation plan (`plan.md`)
3. Break plan into tasks (`tasks.md`)
4. Begin adapter module scaffolding (Gradle subproject, base classes)
5. Alternatively: start Feature 009 (Toolchain & Quality Platform) if preferred

## SDD Gaps
- None — all checks passed in retro audit
