# Pending Task

**Focus**: Feature 002 — PingAccess Adapter implementation
**Status**: Documentation aligned and ready. No implementation code exists yet (T-002-01 through T-002-02 still pending).
**Next Step**: Implement T-002-01 (ErrorMode and SchemaValidation enums) and T-002-02 (MessageTransformConfig)

## Context Notes
- All spec/plan/tasks/scenarios are now aligned with the current core API types (MessageBody, HttpHeaders, SessionContext)
- T-002-01 and T-002-02 were falsely marked complete in a prior session (no code or commits) — now correctly reset to [ ]
- The `/audit` workflow was created for systematic feature documentation auditing
- PaVersionGuard reflection exemption is documented in plan.md (I12a + backlog)

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- None — retro ledger resolved.
