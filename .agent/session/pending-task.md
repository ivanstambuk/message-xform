# Pending Task

**Focus**: Feature 001 — Message Transformation Engine (core specification)
**Status**: Spec draft ~85% complete. 7/9 open questions resolved. Governance infrastructure built.
**Next Step**: Resolve Q-008 (chained/pipeline transforms) — Decision Card already prepared.

## Context Notes
- Decision Card for Q-008 was presented but user chose to do retro before answering.
  Resume by re-presenting Q-008.
- After Q-008, resolve Q-009 (retroactive ADRs for JSLT/SPI/JsonNode choices).
- After both Q's: spec is ready for plan.md and tasks.md authoring.
- All governance infrastructure is in place (constitution, terminology, knowledge map,
  docs style guide, analysis gate, templates, workflows).

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- FR-001-08 (Reusable Mappers): scenarios pending — need mapperRef spec detail first.
- FR-001-09 (Schema Validation): scenarios pending — need test vector design.
- ADR-0001: validating scenarios marked as pending (blocked on FR-001-09 scenarios).
- NFR-001-02, 05, 06: verified by static analysis / integration test, not scenario-testable.
