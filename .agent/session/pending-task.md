# Pending Task

**Focus**: Feature 001 — Session Context Binding (Phase 10)
**Status**: ✅ Complete — all 4 tasks (T-001-54..57) implemented, tested, documented, committed.
**Next Step**: No pending implementation work for Feature 001. Feature is fully complete.

## Context Notes
- Feature 001 is now ✅ Complete across all 10 phases (57 tasks, 84+ scenarios).
- JSLT `contains()` gotcha documented in AGENTS.md Known Pitfalls.
- Rule 19 (Spec Amendment Cascade) codified as a new governance rule.
- `git filter-branch` was running in background during this session (email rewrite).

## Suggested Next Session Options
1. **Feature 009 (Toolchain & Quality)** — spec is ready, could begin planning/implementation.
2. **Feature 002 or 003** — PingAccess/PingGateway adapters now unblocked by Feature 001 completion.
3. **Feature 004 follow-up** — session context adapter-side population for standalone proxy.
4. **Documentation polish** — README, architecture diagrams, or other user-facing docs.

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- None — all retro findings resolved.
