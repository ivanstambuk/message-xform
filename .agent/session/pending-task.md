# Pending Task

**Focus**: No active implementation task
**Status**: Clean — all Feature 001 conditional response routing work is complete.
**Next Step**: Review PLAN.md for next feature or backlog item.

## Context Notes
- Feature 001 is fully implemented: core engine, PingAccess adapter, E2E tests (39/39).
- Conditional response routing (match.status + match.when) is the latest addition.
- Research doc retired — ADR-0036 is the canonical reference.
- 6 local commits ahead of origin, need to push.

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- None. Retro audit passed with 3 minor spec fixes applied.
