# Pending Task

**Focus**: Feature 002 implementation kickoff (adapter bridge)
**Status**: Planning/docs are aligned; implementation has not started beyond completed Phase 1 config tasks.
**Next Step**: Execute `T-002-03` (`wrapRequest()` URI split: path + query), test-first.

## Context Notes
- Feature 002 now tracks 36 scenarios (`S-002-01..S-002-35` + `S-002-35a`).
- `S-002-35a` captures ADR-0035 runtime version mismatch WARN-remediation behavior.
- Plan/spec/tasks/knowledge-map were synced during retro.
- `open-questions.md` is empty.

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- None identified in this retro pass.
