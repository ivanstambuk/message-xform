# Pending Task

**Focus**: Documentation restructuring complete — no pending restructuring work
**Status**: All four guides restructured and committed
**Next Step**: Return to Feature 003 (PingGateway adapter) implementation work

## Context Notes
- All SDK guides (PA, PF, PG) and the PA operations guide now use thematic Parts
- PingGateway SDK guide was renamed from research doc and restructured
- Feature 003 spec draft exists at `docs/architecture/features/003/spec.md`
- No code implementation has started for Feature 003 yet

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- None identified — this was a documentation-only session
