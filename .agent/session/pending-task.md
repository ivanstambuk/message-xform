# Pending Task

**Focus**: Feature 004 (Standalone Proxy) Implementation Planning
**Status**: Research complete, Spec written, Scenarios defined.
**Next Step**: Create implementation plan (`docs/architecture/features/004/plan.md`) and task breakdown.

## Context Notes
- Feature 004 is the "Reference Adapter" — code quality is paramount.
- Javalin 6 (Jetty 12) + Virtual Threads is the chosen stack (ADR-0029).
- Docker/K8s deployment is in scope.
- All docs (spec, scenarios, ADRs, terminology) are consistent and audited.

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- None. Retro audit cleanly passed.
