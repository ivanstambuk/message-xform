# Pending Task

**Focus**: SDK Guide Enrichment — completed
**Status**: All batches done, committed, plan deleted
**Next Step**: Begin Feature 002 implementation or pick next feature

## Context Notes
- `pingaccess-sdk-guide.md` is now 2803 lines, 18 sections, 112 SDK classes — fully standalone
- Legacy migration content (pre-5.0/6.0) was deliberately excluded per user preference
- The guide now incorporates the official SDK Javadoc, sample rules, AND the official docs chapter
- Knowledge map updated to reference the SDK guide as primary PA SDK reference

## SDD Gaps (if any)
- None — documentation-only session, no spec/scenario/ADR changes needed
