## Product Lineage (for clarity)

| Product | Lineage | Docker Image | Our Version |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **PingDirectory** | Ping Identity (UnboundID) | `pingidentity/pingdirectory` | 11.0 |
| **PingAM** | ForgeRock (OpenAM) | Custom build (WAR on Tomcat) | 8.0.2 |
| **PingAccess** | Ping Identity | `pingidentity/pingaccess` | 9.0 |

> Both Ping Identity and ForgeRock are now owned by Thoma Bravo and product lines
> are merging. PingAM 8.0.2 works directly on PingDirectory 11.0 (verified).

## Phase 1 — Verify PingDirectory as AM Backend

**Goal:** Confirm PingDirectory (Ping Identity, not ForgeRock PingDS) can serve
as PingAM's config store, CTS store, and identity store. This is the critical
assumption underpinning the 3-container architecture.

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1.1 | Research PingAM 8.0 docs for PingDirectory compatibility | ✅ Done |
| 1.2 | Check if `pingidentity/pingdirectory` image supports AM setup profiles | ✅ Done |
| 1.3 | Test: start PingDirectory container, inspect available schemas | ⏭️ Skipped (not needed for decision) |
| 1.4 | Document findings — confirm or reject 3-container architecture | ✅ Done |

**Risk:** If PingDirectory cannot serve as AM's config/CTS store, we fall back
to a 4-container architecture (PingAccess + PingAM + PingDS + PingDirectory)
similar to the webinar reference.

### Step 1.1 Findings

PingAM 8.0 docs state the following store requirements:

| Store | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Configuration** | PingDS **or** file-based config (FBC, new in AM 8.0) |
| **CTS tokens** | Must be PingDS |
| **Policy store** | Must be PingDS |
| **Application store** | Must be PingDS |
| **UMA store** | Must be PingDS |
| **Identity/User store** | Any LDAPv3 — PingDirectory, AD, Oracle, etc. |

Critical observations:
1. The Ping docs use "PingDS" ambiguously — sometimes meaning "ForgeRock DS",
   sometimes meaning "PingDirectory". Need practical verification.
2. **File-based config (FBC)** is a new option in AM 8.0 — config stored in JSON
   files on the filesystem instead of LDAP. This could eliminate the config store
   dependency on PingDS entirely.
3. The `pingidentity/pingdirectory` Docker image supports **server profiles**
   via `SERVER_PROFILE_URL` / `SERVER_PROFILE_PATH` env vars. These can include
   LDIF files for am-config/am-cts schema, which may make PingDirectory usable
   as the CTS/policy store.
4. The webinar reference uses PingDS for AM internals and PingDirectory for
   user data — this is the proven pattern.

**Decision required:** Two viable architectures:
- **Option A (3 containers):** PingAM with FBC + PingDirectory (user/CTS store)
  — requires AM 8.0 FBC + verifying PD can host CTS/policy data
- **Option B (4 containers):** PingAM + PingDS (config/CTS) + PingDirectory
  (user store) + PingAccess — proven pattern from webinar
- **Option C (3 containers, PingDS only):** PingAM + PingDS (config/CTS/identity)
  + PingAccess — simplest, but uses PingDS instead of PingDirectory for users

→ Proceeding with Step 1.2 to verify `pingidentity/pingdirectory` image capabilities.

### Step 1.2 Findings

The `pingidentity/pingdirectory:11.0.0.1-latest` Docker image:
- Uses `SERVER_PROFILE_URL`/`SERVER_PROFILE_PATH` for configuration
- Uses `pd.profile` (PingDirectory profile), **not** `--profile am-config` (PingDS syntax)
- Has `USER_BASE_DN=dc=example,dc=com`, `ROOT_USER_DN=cn=administrator`
- Supports `MAKELDIF_USERS` for auto-generating test users
- Full TLS support via env vars

PingDS (`opendj/setup`) and PingDirectory use **different setup mechanisms**:
- PingDS: `--profile am-config --profile am-cts --profile am-identity-store`
- PingDirectory: `pd.profile` directory structure with LDIF files

While PingDirectory *could* theoretically host AM data via custom LDIF schema
imports, this is untested and fragile. The `--profile am-config` etc. are PingDS
specific setup profiles that create the exact schema, indexes, and bind accounts
that PingAM expects.

### Step 1.4 — Architectural Decision (REVISED)

**Decision: 3-container architecture** (PingAccess + PingAM + PingDirectory)

**⚠️ Original decision (D4) was WRONG.** Live testing on Feb 16, 2026 proved that
PingAM 8.0.2 runs directly on PingDirectory 11.0 without PingDS. Two tweaks needed:

1. **Schema relaxation**: `single-structural-objectclass-behavior: accept`
   PingAM writes LDAP entries without structural objectClasses that PD rejects.
2. **ETag virtual attribute**: PingAM CTS expects `etag` attribute for optimistic
   concurrency. PD doesn't have it natively but `ds-entry-checksum` serves same
   purpose. A mirror virtual attribute maps `ds-entry-checksum → etag`.

**Test evidence:**
- PingAM configurator loaded 98+ schema files into PD (all successful)
- CTS token store created at `ou=tokens,dc=example,dc=com` (13 entries)
- PD access log showed 4000+ operations from AM (all resultCode=0)
- Admin authentication returned valid `tokenId` and `iPlanetDirectoryPro` cookie
