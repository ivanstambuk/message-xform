# Platform transform profile — routes specs to AM authentication API paths
#
# This profile implements the clean API surface for authentication endpoints
# fronted by PingAccess. Uses profile-level chaining (ADR-0008) to separate
# concerns and body-predicate routing (ADR-0036, match.when) to discriminate
# between WebAuthn and login callback responses.
#
# Routing logic (for POST /am/json/authenticate responses):
#
#   Has TextOutputCallback with "navigator.credentials"?
#     YES → am-webauthn-response (passkey registration/authentication)
#     NO  → am-auth-response-v2  (login callbacks + success responses)
#
#   Both routes chain into am-strip-internal to remove _-prefixed fields.
#
# AM paths arrive as /am/json/... through the PA reverse proxy.
#
# Auth flows:
#   POST /api/v1/auth/login     → PA proxies to → /am/json/authenticate
#   POST /api/v1/auth/passkey/* → PA proxies to → /am/json/authenticate
#   Response transforms:
#     WebAuthn: am-webauthn-response → am-strip-internal
#     Login:   am-auth-response-v2   → am-strip-internal
